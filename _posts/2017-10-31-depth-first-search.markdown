DFS is one of the most famous graph traversal algorithms. 

The algorithm visits nodes in an order such that the traversal takes place on every child and grandchild of a node before finishing that node.

Time complexity: *O(V+E)* where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of DFS: [DFS](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/13.DFS.cpp)
