LCS is one of the most popular instances of effective use of dynamic programming.
Although it is possible to easily implement a solution to LCS using recursion, my solution uses an iterative way. 

LCS made scientists able to get further in gene alignments with some additions to its structure.

Time complexity: *O(nm)* where *n* is the length of the first string and *m* is the length of the second one.

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of LCS: [LCS](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/14.LCS.cpp)
