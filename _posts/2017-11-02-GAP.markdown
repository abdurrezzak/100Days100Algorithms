Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a little different from LCS as it allows mismatches. The algorithms takes two strings and aligns them by repecting the penalty scores and reward score, alignes them.

Time complexity: *O(nm)* where *n* is the length of the first string and *m* is the length of the second one.

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Needleman- Wunsch: [Needleman - Wunsch](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/15.GAP.cpp)
