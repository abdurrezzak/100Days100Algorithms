Euclidian GCD algorithm is used for calculating greatest common divisor of two numbers- depending on data type, the numbers may be double or int etc. 

The algorithm has two steps:
  -> Checks if b divides a
    ->If yes, returns b immediately
    ->If not, tries the same for b and a%b
    
Time complexity: *O(log(ab))* (It happens when a and b are Fibonacci numbers that are consecutive)

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Euclidian GCD: [Euclidian GCD](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/4.EuclidianGCD.cpp)
