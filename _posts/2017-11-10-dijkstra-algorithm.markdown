Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm is  a single source shortest path algorithm that is very similar to Prim's MST algorithm.

The algorithm is also greedy as Prim's and chooses the closest vertex to existing shortest path network on the graph.


Time complexity: *O(ElogV)* 

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm: [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/23.DijkstraAlgorithm.cpp)
