0/1 Knapsack problem is one of the most popular optimization problems out there. 

The problem considers a knapsack and n items that have different weights and different values. 

The knapsack can hold elements whose total makes *M kg* or less.

Dynamic programming helps us find the biggest value that can be reached.

Time complexity: *O(nm)* (In an iterative solution, the complexity can be reduced to linear time by just storing last two rows)

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Knapsack: [0/1 Knapsack](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/17.Knapsack.cpp)
