Selection Sort is a very inefficient sorting algorithm. 

The algorithm takes an array and starts from its first index. Finds the smallest element and places it in the first index. Repeats this operation for every index and finally sorts the array.

Time complexity: *O(n^2)*

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Selection Sort: [Selection Sort](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/5.SelectionSort.cpp)
