Bucket sort is another trivial and famous sorting algorithm which works well when there are uniformly distributed floating point numbers to sort.

The idea is to place numbers into buckets(vectors or linked lists) according to their first decimals.

Time complexity: *O(n+k)* where k is the number of buckets

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Bucket Sort: [Bucket Sort](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/11.BucketSort.cpp)
