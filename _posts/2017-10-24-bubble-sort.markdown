Bubble Sort is also a very inefficient and easy sorting algorithm. 

The algorithm takes an array and sorts it by comparing every two consecutive elements and placing them in correct order.

Time complexity: *O(n^2)*

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Bubble Sort: [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/6.BubbleSort.cpp)
