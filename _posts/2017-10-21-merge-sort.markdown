Merge Sort is a fast sorting algorithm. 

The algorithm is straightforward. Divides the array into two parts until all of the parts have two elements. 
Sorts these small parts and starts merging them until the array is fully sorted. 

Time complexity: *O(nlogn)*

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of Merge Sort: [Merge Sort](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/3.MergeSort.cpp)
