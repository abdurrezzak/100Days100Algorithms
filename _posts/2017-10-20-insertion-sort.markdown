Insertion sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is desirable when the data size is relatively smaller or nearly sorted. 

Insertion sort starts with a pointer that assumes the first element as a sorted subarray of the original array.
The pointer moves on and in every iteration; places the new element in its correct place in the sorted subarray.

The sorted subarray grows and at the end, the array is sorted. 

Time complexity: *O($\sqrt{n^2}$)*
