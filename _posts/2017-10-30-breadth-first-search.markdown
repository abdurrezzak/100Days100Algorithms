BFS is one of the most famous graph traversal algorithms. 

The algorithm, as the name posits, visits the first level child nodes first and goes on searching.

Time complexity: *O(V+E)* where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges

Here is the link of my C++ implementation of BFS: [BFS](https://github.com/abdurrezzak/100-Days-100-Algorithms-/blob/master/12.BFS.cpp)
